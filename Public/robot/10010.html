Now you can dig deeper into ideas with new, original books from TED. Long enough to explore a powerful idea but short enough to read in a single sitting, TED Books pick up where TED Talks leave off. This wide-ranging series covers everything from architecture to business, space travel to love, and is perfect for anyone with a curious mind and an expansive love of learning.
